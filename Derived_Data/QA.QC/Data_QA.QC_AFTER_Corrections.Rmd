# Introduction
This notebook carries out some basic data QA/QC checks on the raw data. 
This version runs the QA/QC checks on the CORRECTED data.

Note that this is based on analyzing the data already reorganized according to
the code in the "Data_Reorganization_2.Rmd" R
notebook.

# Import Libraries
```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Import Data
```{r}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent <- dirname(dirname(getwd()))               # actually a grandparent
sibling <- paste(parent,sibfldnm, sep = '/')
fn <- 'presumpscot_CORRECTED.csv'

presumpscot_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn),
    col_types = cols(Ecoli = col_double(),
                     X1 = col_skip()))

presumpscot_data <- presumpscot_data %>%
  select (-Time) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, '%m')),
                        labels = month.abb[5:9]))  # Note that as.numeric()
                                                   # will not give month number
```

# Data Prevalence
## *E.coli* Data by Year
```{r}
presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Year)%>%
  summarize(n=sum(! is.na(Ecoli)))%>%
  spread(Year, n)
```

## DO Data by Year
```{r}
presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Year)%>%
  summarize(n=sum(! is.na(DO)))%>%
  spread(Year, n)
```
Apparently, a total of 47 locations have been sampled by PRW since 2009. The
normal sampling plan in each year is to sample a fixed number of Saturdays,
usually eight.  We often see more than eight sample records at a site within a
year.  Generally this is because QA/QC replicate samples were collected, or DO
data were collected at different depths on one sample date.  Multiple depth
samples were only collected in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

Prior analysis has shown little effect of sample depth.  There sometimes are
substantial differences in observed *E. coli* values for replicate samples,
expressed as a percent difference.  On a log scale, however, the differences are
less apparent.

## Number of Sites per Year
```{r}
presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Year, Site)%>%
  summarize(n=sum(! is.na(DO)))%>%
  summarize(nsites = sum(n>0))
```

# Create a "Surface Water Only" Data Set
Note that this is not necessary for E.Coli, but is helpful for analyzing the DO data
```{r}
surface_data <- presumpscot_data %>%
  filter(is.na(Depth) | Depth == 0)
```

```{r}
cat('All Data\n')
a <- with(presumpscot_data, cbind(length(Ecoli),
                             sum(! is.na(Ecoli)),
                             sum(! is.na(DO))))
colnames(a) <- c('N', 'E.coli', 'DO')
a

cat('Surface Data\n')
a <- with(surface_data, cbind(length(Ecoli),
                         sum(! is.na(Ecoli)),
                         sum(! is.na(DO))))
colnames(a) <- c('N', 'E.coli', 'DO')
a
rm(a)
```
We lose approximately 100 samples, all affecting DO samples, not *E. coli*
samples.

# Analysis of Duplicates
This is for QA/QC purposes.  We may want to look at variation among duplicates.

## *E. coli* Data
```{r}
duplicates = presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Date, Site) %>%
  mutate(nColi= sum(!is.na(Ecoli))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(nColi>1) %>%
  mutate(SampleID = paste0(Site,'.',Date)) %>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  select(SampleID, Site, Date, Year, Month, Ecoli, Flag, DO, PctSat)
```


```{r}
diffs <- duplicates %>%
  group_by(SampleID) %>%
  summarize(Year = min(Year),
            m = (max(Ecoli, na.rm=TRUE)+min(Ecoli, na.rm=TRUE))/2,
            d= max(Ecoli, na.rm=TRUE)-min(Ecoli, na.rm=TRUE),
            pctd = d/m)
  summary(diffs)
```
So, that shows that there are sometimes differences that are extremely large.  A
better analysis might be of logs of abundance, given the heavy skew of the
observed data.

```{r}
ns = diffs %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  mutate(n2 = paste("N=", n))

ggplot(diffs, aes(factor(Year), pctd)) + 
 # geom_boxplot() +
  geom_dotplot( stackdir = "center",
                binaxis = 'y',
                binwidth = .01,
                binpositions="all",
                #position = 'dodge',
                dotsize = .5) +
  geom_text(aes(label=n2, x=factor(Year), y=1.5 ), data=ns, size = 3)
```
So, the most extreme variation came from year 2017, and there were no *E. coli*
duplicates in 2018, and 2019.

Given the skewed nature of the *E. coli* data, these high percent differences
are not dreadful, but they don't make anyone happy either.  A percent difference
of more than 150%, as observed three times in 2017, is problematic.

The lack of duplicate data from 2018 reflects manua ldata handling by PLT.  Toby
Jacobs reports transferring data from a spreadsheet used principally for mapping
purposes, which did not include field replicates.  The field replicates were
apparently collected, just not shared with us.


## DO Data
```{r}
duplicates = presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Date, Site) %>%
  mutate(nDO= sum(!is.na(DO))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(nDO>1) %>%
  mutate(SampleID = paste0(Site,'.',Date)) %>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  select(SampleID, Site, Date, Year, Month, DO, PctSat)
```


```{r}
diffs <- duplicates %>%
  group_by(SampleID) %>%
  summarize(Year = min(Year),
            m = (max(DO, na.rm=TRUE)+min(DO, na.rm=TRUE))/2,
            d= max(DO, na.rm=TRUE)-min(DO, na.rm=TRUE),
            pctd = d/m)
  summary(diffs)
```

So, replicate DO data shows only moderate variation, usually under 1%, with just
a handful of replicates with higher percent differences, and none over 4%.
```{r}
ns = diffs %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  mutate(n2 = paste("N=", n))

ggplot(diffs, aes(x = factor(Year), y = pctd)) +
  geom_dotplot( stackdir = "center",
                binaxis = 'y',
                binwidth = .02,
                binpositions="all",
                #position = 'dodge',
                dotsize = .15) +
  geom_text(aes(label=n2, x=factor(Year), y=0.4), data=ns, size = 3)

```
Just like for the E coli data, percent differences have been greater since 2017.

# Data Evaluation
## E Coli QA/QC Review
### Histograms
```{r}
plt <- ggplot(presumpscot_data, aes(Ecoli)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Flag), bins=50) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors(), name = 'Censored?')
  #geom_density()
plt
```
Notice that the values, while conceptually continuous are converted to select
discrete values by the MPN method used. Technically this is interval censored
data, but there are so many categories that the impact on analysis is probably
small.

The number of "uncensored" large values looks implausibly high, and a close look
shows that several slightly different values are all included with NEARLY
identical values.  I suspect that reflects different coding practices over time.
Again, differences are too small to matter for any quantitative analysis, so we
leave all observations as is.

```{r}
plt  + scale_x_log10()

```
We have a fat tailed mound-like distribution, which suggests a lognormal
distribution may work well for these data.  But note also that we have an excess
of elevated values, if we think this follows a lognormal distribution.  An
alternative is a Pareto Distribution, which also fits these data fairly well.
The Pareto predicts more extreme values than the lognormal. (See analysis
notebooks for more detail).

## Plotting Relationship with DO
We are looking here for any outliers.
```{r}
plt <- ggplot(surface_data, aes(DO, Ecoli)) + geom_point(aes(color=factor(Year))) + geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_log10()
plt
```
Other than a few extreme DO values, there is nothing obviously amiss here.
There is an indication that higher DO is associated with lower *E. coli*, as
might be expected if summer low flows and high temperatures are bad for both
dissolved oxygen and bacteria loads. We can do little more with this based on
these data because we lack temperature data for 2018 and 2019.

## DO QA/QC Review
```{r}
plt <- ggplot(surface_data, aes(x = DO)) +
  geom_histogram()
plt
```

We notice a few implausible high DO observations.

```{r}
plt <- ggplot(surface_data, aes(DO, PctSat)) + geom_point(aes(color =factor(Year))) + geom_smooth()
plt
```
Note a handful of observations that are far from the trend line. After
correction, we retained only a couple of high PctSat values from 2014 and a
couple of elevated OA observations from 2018 and 2019.

```{r}
anomolies <- surface_data %>%
  filter((PctSat>75 & (DO<6 | DO>13)) | (PctSat<25 & DO>4 ) | PctSat>115) %>%
  select(-Name, -QC, -Depth, -Flag, -Month)
anomolies
#write.csv(anomolies,"anomolies.csv")

```
We have been unable to confirm errors in any of these values.

It appears possible that the anomalous values from  
*  CW020, 07/29/2018  
*  PL045  06/01/2019
reflect simple transcription errors where a "1" got added in front of the 
correct DO value, but the error is present in all versions of the data we have
reviewed.  We leave those points in the CSV data, but recommend removing the DO
values before conducting any analyses.

We have no hypothesis for what may have happened in 2014, but we also recommend 
deleting the percent saturation data for those samples.
