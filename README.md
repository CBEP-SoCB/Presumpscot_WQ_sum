Analysis of volunteer water quality monitoring data from Presumpscot River Watch 
and Presumpscot Land Trust.

Presumpscot River Watch and Presumpscot Land Trust have led volunteer-based 
monitoring of water quality in the Presumpscot watershed for a couple of
decades.  More recently, the program has added monitoring of the Stroudwater
watersheds.

Data collected focuses on bacteria (*E. coli* ) and dissolved oxygen levels.
History of monitoring in the region is complex, with some sites monitored for 
just a few years, while other sites have been monitored pretty much every year 
for 20 years or so.

This repository includes no graphics code, as site-by-site variation in 
conditions strongly dominate the observed patterns, and those differences are
most easily shown via maps. The "Analysis" folder includes code that explores
ways to analyze these data to evaluate long-term trends (none were found), and
export data that could be used in GIS to produce informative maps.
