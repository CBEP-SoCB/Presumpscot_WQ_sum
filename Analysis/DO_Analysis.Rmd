# Introduction
This notebook provides a  look at data derived from eleven years of a volunteer
water quality monitoring managed by Presumpscot River Watch (PRW), and more
recently, by the Presumpscot Land Trust (PRLT). The data were delivered to CBEP
by staff at PRLT in March of 2020, incorporating data through 2019.  PRW began
submitting data to DEP in 2009, so the data reviewed here only goes back that
far.

The goal of this analysis was to develop analyses to underpin graphics for the
2020 State of the Bay Report.  However, because results at each monitoring site
differs, results the analyses provide general background. Each site really needs
to be evaluated on its own terms.

Given the large number of sites, there is no convenient way to summarize
results, and so simple frequencies and averages are exported to a CSV file for
import into GIS for graphic display.

# Maine's Numeric Water Quality Standards
Maine's numerical water quality standards for the summer months, as laid out in
statute (38 MRSA 465) are as follows:

|Class|DO ppm "Instantaneous"|DO ppm 30 Day Avg|Percent Saturation|*E. coli* (# per 100 ml) Instantaneous|*E. coli* (# per 100 ml)Geom. Mean|
------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| A | 7 | | 75 % | | |
| B | 7 | | 75 % | 236 | 64 |
| C | 5 | 6.5 | 60 % | 236 | 126 |

(Class "AA" streams are not shown in this table because there are no numerical
standards unique to AA streams.)
Bacteria standards apply over a 90 day period, with the instantaneous standard
not to be exceeded more than 10% of the time over a 90 day period.

  filter(! (is.na(DO) & is.na(PctSat))) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, '%m')),
                        labels = month.abb[5:9]))  %>%  # Note that as.numeric()
                                                       # will not give month 1;12
  mutate(YearF = factor(Year))
```

## Correct Probable Data Errors
Several values are apparent outliers in the source data.  See the notebook
`Data_QA.QC_AFTER_Corrections,Rmd` for details.  These are data that have
unlikely or unreasonable values, but for which we could not confirm a data
handling error, so we remove them here (explicitly for transparency), rather 
than in data preparation code, where this decision might not be obvious.

```{r}
presumpscot_data <- presumpscot_data %>%
mutate( PctSat =  replace(PctSat,
                          Site == 'M030' & Date == as.Date('2014-07-12'), 
                          NA),
        PctSat = replace(PctSat,
                         Site =='PI020' &  Date == as.Date('2014-07-12'),
                         NA),
        DO     = replace(DO,
                         Site =='CW020' &  Date == as.Date('2018-07-29'),
                         NA),
        DO     = replace(DO,
                         Site =='PL045' &  Date == as.Date('2019-06-01'),
                         NA))
```

## Create a "Surface Water Only" Ddata Set
Note that this is not necessary for *E. coli*, but is for DO. Dissolved oxygen
data was collected for several years at multiple depths at certain sites.  While
preliminary analyses suggested that depth had little effect on the DO levels,
focusing on a "surface water only" data set simplifies the analysis slightly, by
not requiring us to check.
```{r}
surface_data <- presumpscot_data %>%
  filter(is.na(Depth) | Depth == 0)
```

```{r}
cat('All Data\n')
a <- with(presumpscot_data, cbind(length(DO),
                             sum(! is.na(DO))))
colnames(a) <- c('N', 'DO')
a

cat('Surface Data\n')
a <- with(surface_data, cbind(length(DO),
                         sum(! is.na(DO))))
colnames(a) <- c('N', 'DO')
a
rm(a)
```
So we dropped 102 DO samples by restricting attention to surface water samples
only. 

```{r}
presumpscot_data <- surface_data
rm(surface_data)
```

# List Sites for Specific Analyses
A total of 47 locations have been sampled by PRW and PRLT since 2009. The normal
sampling plan in each year is to sample a fixed number of Saturdays, usually 
eight.  We often see more than eight sample records at a site within a year.
Generally this is because QA/QC replicates were collected. Multiple depth samples
were only collected in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

## Trend Analysis
Here we create a vector of sites sampled at least five times.  Note that this 
omits some recent sites, but provides the sites for which trend analysis may be 
useful.
```{r}
trendsites <- presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(sampled = n()>0,
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarise(yrssampled = sum(sampled)) %>%
  filter(yrssampled>=5) %>%
  pull(Site)
trendsites
```
Twenty nine sites have been sampled at least five times, and thus could be used
to estimate / study trends.

## Recent Sites
We look at data collected over the past five years, restricted to sites with
at least two years of data.  No site with at least two years of data has 
fewer than 15 samples. This cuts out some sites that have only recently been 
added to the monitoring program.
```{r}
recentsites <- presumpscot_data %>%
  filter(Year>2014) %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(sampled = n()>0,
            samples = n(),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarise(yrssampled = sum(sampled),
            samples=sum(samples),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(yrssampled > 2) %>%
  arrange(samples)
recentsites
```
```{r}
recentsites <- recentsites %>% pull(Site)
```

# DO Graphics
## Histograms
```{r}
m <- mean(presumpscot_data$DO, na.rm = TRUE)
s <- sd(presumpscot_data$DO, na.rm = TRUE)
plt <- ggplot(presumpscot_data, aes(DO)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins=50) +
  geom_density(color = 'orange') +
  geom_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = m, sd = s), color = 'red')
plt
```
So, clearly a negatively skewed, fat tailed distribution, with low values that
turn up more frequently than expected under a normal distribution.

```{r}
m <- mean(presumpscot_data$PctSat, na.rm = TRUE)
s <- sd(presumpscot_data$PctSat, na.rm = TRUE)
plt <- ggplot(presumpscot_data, aes(PctSat)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins=50) +
  geom_density(color = 'orange') +
  geom_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = m, sd = s), color = 'red')
plt
```
Percent Saturation is even more heavily skewed.  Although this is not a true
percentage, it is effectively ratio of random variables, and so might
be expected to be distributed closer to Cauchy.

## Percent Saturation vs. DO
```{r}
plt <- ggplot(presumpscot_data, aes(DO, PctSat)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color =factor(Year))) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=75, color='red') +
  geom_hline(yintercept=60, color='orange') +
  
    geom_vline(xintercept=5, color='red') +
  geom_vline(xintercept=6.5, color='orange') +
  geom_vline(xintercept=7, color='yellow') +
  theme_minimal()
plt
```

The relationship between DO and percent saturation is about as one would expect,
with a largely linear relationship for low concentrations of DO, but a
curvilinear relationship as DO levels exceed about 80%.

# Linear Models
All analyses here are a bit cavalier, as we end up concluding that we will not
use specific results of these analyses directly in SoCB.  We do not, for
example, conduct all relevant model diagnostics, and do not search for
alternative models that may provide better estimates of standard errors and 
nominal p values.  That is important because we know both DO and Percent
Saturation figures are likely to be somewhat to highly skewed, with significant 
kurtosis. The justification is that we can not look at results across all
monitoring sites, and probably should lookat each monitoring site individually,
and we do not have the space in SoCB to do so effectively.  The only summaries
we use therefore are site by site means and frequencies.

## Dissolved Oxygen
```{r}
do_lm <- lm(DO ~ Site + Month + YearF + Site:YearF, data = presumpscot_data)
do_lm_2 <- lm(DO ~ Site + Month + Year + Site:Year, data = presumpscot_data)
fin_mod <- step(do_lm)
fin_mod_2 <- step(do_lm_2)
```

```{r}
anova(fin_mod)
anova(fin_mod_2)
```
So, in both cases, the best model (by AIC) includes both year and year by site 
interaction terms, and fitting a separate value for each year provides a 
stronger fit than fitting a linear term.

That means we have no real pattern to point to across sites.  We need to
evaluate each site more or less independently.  There is little evidence for
a meaningful trend across the region.

To evaluate the temporal pattern, we can fit a model by year that treats each
site as a random factor, and focuses on average conditions year by year across
sites. We include the MOnth term in the model to reduce variance estimates.
```{r}
thlmer <- lmer(DO ~ YearF + Month + ( 1 | Site), data = presumpscot_data)
anova(thlmer)
```
```{r}
summary(thlmer)
```


```{r}
plot(emmeans(thlmer, 'Month'))
```

Note that dissolved oxygen follows the pattern one might expect based on
seasonal temperatures, with the highest DO occurring early in the year,
and lowest occurring in summer.

```{r}
plot(emmeans(thlmer, 'YearF'))
```

As for the *E. coli* data, there is no robust long term trend here.  Although a
"significant" trend can be detected statistically via a linear model, its slope 
is low, and it is a spurious value that hides site to site and year to year
variation.

## Percent Saturation
```{r}
pctsat_lm <- lm(PctSat ~ Site + Month + YearF + Site:YearF, data = presumpscot_data)
pctsat_lm_2 <- lm(PctSat ~ Site + Month + Year + Site:Year, data = presumpscot_data)
fin_mod <- step(pctsat_lm)
fin_mod_2 <- step(pctsat_lm_2)
```

```{r}
anova(fin_mod)
anova(fin_mod_2)
```
So, in both cases, the best model (by AIC) includes both year and year by site 
interaction terms, and fitting a separate value for each year provides a 
stronger fit than fitting a linear term (where the term does not achieve 
significance).

That means we have no real pattern to point to across sites.  We need to
evaluate each site independently.  There is no evidence for
a meaningful trend across the region.

To evaluate the temporal pattern, we can fit a model by year that treats each
site as a random factor, and focuses on average conditions year by year across
sites. We include the Month term in the model to reduce variance estimates.
```{r}
thlmer <- lmer(PctSat ~ YearF + Month + ( 1 | Site), data = presumpscot_data)
```
```{r}
summary(thlmer)
```


```{r}
plot(emmeans(thlmer, 'Month'))
```

Percent Saturation also shows a seasonal (Monthly) signal, which is somewhat
harder to explain than variation in dissolved oxygen alone, although the
variation in mean percent saturation is relatively small -- ranging only from
about 80% to about 90%.  If seasonal patterns were the focus of our analysis, we
would need to fit additional models with site by month interaction terms, and
probably treat Year as the random factor here, not sites.

```{r}
plot(emmeans(thlmer, 'YearF'))
```

## Models Including Temperature
The fact that Percent Saturation models show reduced signal compared to DO 
models suggests that year to year variation in temperature may be important.

### Graph Annual Average Temperatures
```{r}
presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(mean_temp = mean(Temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, mean_temp)) +
  geom_line()
```
Average water temperatures are not especially closely correlated with anual 
average air temperatures. (Based on an informal comparison with NWS data 
from the Portland Jetport.)


### Construct a Linear Mixed Model
We fit a non-linear term for temperature, as we expect the relationship to
be non-linear.  Our interest, however, focuses on the residual effects on 
dissolved oxygen.  Note we are NOT fitting interaction terms with site here,
even though they are likely important. The point here is just to evaluate
whether there is a strong regional trend over time that might justify presenting
simplified graphics in SoCB.  We conclude there is not.
```{r}
t_lmer <- lmer(DO~ Temp + I(Temp^2) +  Month + YearF + (1 | Site),
               data = presumpscot_data)
```

```{r}
summary(t_lmer)
```
After accounting for temperature, we still see a couple of anomalous years,
specifically 2011, 2014, and 2016.  
*  2016 was a year with low summer flows after a wet spring.  
*  2014 shows no precipitation at all in summer months (At least according to 
   Portland Jetport weather data.  This is so unlikely, that we wonder if it is 
   a data error of some kind, although apparently not flagged as such).  It was
   also an unusually hot summer, with Monthly mean temperatures a couple of 
   degrees C higher than usual.
*  2011 was a fairly normal rainfall year.

But that is all data cherry picking, so should not be taken too seriously 
without more rigorous evaluation.

```{r}
plot(emmeans(t_lmer, 'Month'))
```
After accounting for temperature variation, there is very little variation
in dissolved oxygen by month, although DO corrected from temperature does appear 
to drop at the end of the season. 

```{r}
plot(emmeans(t_lmer, 'YearF'))
```

And there is no meaningful trend over time.

# Export Tabular Data for GIS
We want to create a table of results to import into GIS.  We have interest in
both mean dissolved oxygen levels and frequency of exceedences of DO criteria.

We focus on the last five years of the record, and do not want to segregate by
year, so we recalculate site by site frequencies and averages here.
```{r}
do_ins <- presumpscot_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(DO)) %>%
  filter(Site %in% recentsites) %>%
  filter (Year > 2014) %>%
  
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(DO_Sample = sum(! is.na(DO)),
            DO_AB = sum(DO >= 7, na.rm = TRUE),
            DO_C = sum(DO<7 & DO>=5),
            DO_NA = sum(DO < 5 ),
            DO_Avg = mean(DO, na.rm = TRUE),
            DO_SD = sd(DO, na.rm = TRUE),            
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r}
ps_ins <- presumpscot_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(PctSat)) %>%
  filter(Site %in% recentsites) %>%
  filter(Year > 2014) %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(PS_Sample = sum(! is.na(PctSat)),
            PS_AB = sum(PctSat>=75, na.rm=TRUE),
            PS_C = sum(PctSat<75 & PctSat>=60, na.rm=TRUE),
            PS_NA = sum(PctSat<60, na.rm=TRUE),
            PS_Avg = mean(PctSat, na.rm = TRUE),
            PS_SD = sd(PctSat, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r}
do_results <- do_ins %>%
  full_join(ps_ins, by = 'Site')
```

## Add Code To calculate Class
To Calculate teh Observed Class, we need to look at the probability of violating
water quality thresholds.

Technically, any violation of standards for dissolved oxygen controls whether a 
violation of water quality standards has occurred.  But on some level, with a 
long record, we may want to be more forgiving and allow a rare problem.  In the
following, we accept zero or one exceedences of a standard before we declare the
site to have failed that standard.

Rather than expressing our results in 'Class AB', 'Class C', 'Non Attainment' 
terms, which are unlikely to be widely understood by the SoCB audience, we
express results in terms of 'Excellent', 'Good', and 'Poor', water quality.
The thresholds, however, reflect Maine water quality standards.

```{r}
do_results <- do_results %>%
mutate(DO_Meets = if_else(DO_NA < 2,
                          if_else(DO_C < 2,
                                  'Excellent',
                                  'Good'),
                          'Poor'),
       PS_Meets = if_else(PS_NA < 2,
                          if_else(PS_C < 2,
                                  'Excellent',
                                  'Good'),
                          'Poor'
                           ),
       Both_Meets =  if_else(DO_NA < 2 & PS_NA < 2,
                          if_else(DO_C < 2 & PS_C < 2,
                                  'Excellent',
                                  'Good'),
                          'Poor')) %>%
  
  # The following has no effect on the achieved classification in our data.
  # We include it here for completeness.
  mutate(All_Meets = if_else(DO_Avg < 6.5, 'Poor', Both_Meets))
```

```{r}
write_csv(do_results, 'DO_Results.csv')
```

# Complex Site by Time Graphics
These graphics are too complex for use in SoCB, but they are nevertheless of
interest.

## Instantaneous DO Standards (7, 5 mg/l)
```{r}
do_ins <- presumpscot_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  filter(! is.na(DO)) %>%
  filter(Site %in% recentsites) %>%
  summarise(Sample = sum(! is.na(DO)),
            AB = sum(DO >= 7, na.rm = TRUE),
            C = sum(DO<7 & DO>=5),
            `NA` = sum(DO < 5 ),
            DO_Avg = mean(DO, na.rm = TRUE),
            DO_SD = sd(DO, na.rm = TRUE),            
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r fig.width=9.5, fig.height=7}
plt <- do_ins %>%
  select(-Sample, -DO_Avg, -DO_SD) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Site, Year, ),
               names_to = 'Category',
               values_to = 'Count') %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(Year, Count, fill = Category)) +
  geom_area(position = position_stack()) +   # alternative is position_fill()
  facet_wrap(~ Site)  +
  labs(title =("Instantaneous DO Standards"),
       x = "Year",
       y = " Observations Meeting Class") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors2()[4:2], name = '') + 
  
  theme_cbep() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::number_format(accuracy = 1),
                     breaks = c(2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019))
plt

```
So, the bottom line is, failure of low DO standards for class B are  rare, 
and occur at only a couple of locations. For some sites, the displays are
misleading, because they fail to connect non-adjacent years, thus omitting 
information.

## Instantaneous Saturation Standards (75%, 60%)
```{r}
ps_ins <- presumpscot_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(PctSat)) %>%
  filter(Site %in% recentsites) %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarise(Sample = sum(! is.na(PctSat)),
            Excellent = sum(PctSat>=75, na.rm=TRUE),
            Good = sum(PctSat<75 & PctSat>=60, na.rm=TRUE),
            Poor = sum(PctSat<60, na.rm=TRUE),
            PctSat_Avg = mean(PctSat, na.rm = TRUE),
            PctSat_SD = sd(PctSat, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r fig.width=9.5, fig.height=7}

plt <- ps_ins %>%
  select(-Sample, -PctSat_Avg, -PctSat_SD) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Site, Year, ),
               names_to = 'Category',
               values_to = 'Count') %>%

  ggplot(aes(Year, Count, fill=Category)) +
  geom_area(position = position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(~Site)  +
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2017, 2018, 2019)) +
  #scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(1:6*2))

  labs(title =("Instantaneous Percent Saturation Standards"),
       x = "Year",
       y = " Observations Meeting Class") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors2()[4:2], name = '') + 
  
  theme_cbep() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::number_format(accuracy = 1),
                     breaks = c(2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019))
plt
```

So, failure of the Pct Saturation standards happened only a few times also, and 
only at a handful of sites.
